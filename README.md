# [Terapify](https://www.terapify.com) Backend Challenge (Terapi-schedule)

Develop a REST API that allows to users know the available psychologists hours and create/schedule an appoiment in some of these, ensuring that the space is available.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Javascript
- **WebFramewrok**: ExpressJs
- **Security**: JWT cookie based
- **DB**: MongoDB


## Features

- RESTFul API
- Request validation (Joi)
- SwaggerDocs (swaggger-generator)
- Scope validation (roles: patient & psy)
- Docker based
- Github Actions for CICD
- Automatic deploy after tests on PaaS (Heroku)
- PM2 as runtime manager in production
- Git hooks trhough husky to format the code before commits
- Standard and prettier as code formats

> psy - refers to psychologists

## Docs

The API is completely documented.

- If you run the project in local, you can interact with the swagger docs in:
  - http://localhost:3000/api-docs

- Also you can visit the interactive docs of deployed version in:
  - https://terapi-schedule.herokuapp.com/api-docs

## Architecture

There are two main folders:
- **tests** - Contain files with e2e testing of all endpoints of each entitie.
- **src** - Contain the main source code of application.

The source code is divided in:

- **bin**: Contain the entrypoint script to lauch the server
- **config**: Contain all app settings and secret vars
- **lib**: Contain all common functionalities(swagger server, logger, error manager)
  - ***auth***: Authorization & authentication tools
  - ***db***: Db connection and general CRUD class
- **middleware**: Contain all used middlewares (request validation, not found, error)
- **components**: Contain all API entities:
  - ***patients***: Operations about patients
  - ***psy***: Operations about psychologists
  - ***agenda***: Operationas about agenda (Is used by psychologists)
  - ***appoiment***: Operations about appoiments (Is used by patients)

## Usage

- First clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emanuelosva/terapi-schedule
```

- Build the docker image.

First go to the .env.example file and rename as .env and fill the
required config vars.
The mongo DB_URL is by default for dev: `mongodb://db:27017/terapischedule`

Run the following command to build the Docker image.

```bash
npm run build:docker
```

- Lauch the server and the development MongoDB instance:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Perform tests in Docker container:

```bash
npm run test:dev
```

- Open html test report (comman available for ubuntu):

```bash
npm run test:dev
```
